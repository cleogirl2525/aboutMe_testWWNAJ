    In her work SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY uses the language of BDSM to point to the hidden power relations that are at play not only in our intimate lives but in every facet of society. Whereas power and desire are negotiated explicitly and consensually during erotic roleplaying, our culture tends to be unaccountable to its constant creation of and participation in everyday acts of dominance and submission; one example being the violent reinforcement of normative standards like heterosexuality and gender conformity. For the artist this power structure becomes particularly clear in the digital realm, everytime we go online algorithms fire command and request that parallel the BDSM dynamic.

    HOLLOWAY’s ._SUITABLE_FOR.EXE[CUTION] installation is a highly complex, preprogrammed, push to start system that incorporates sculpture, sound, video, creative coding, text and performance to create a portrait of a machine performing labor. The apparatus is structured around four sculptures, [SIT] STAY FETCH SPEAK.obj, SIT [STAY] FETCH SPEAK.obj, SIT STAY [FETCH] SPEAK.obj, and SIT STAY FETCH [SPEAK].obj that  function as a physical score through which an algorithmic performance is run. There are remnants from an accompanying live performance of a sci-fi survival game between four captive animals and their ruthless handler.  Human desire and machine desire become indistinguishable. The system seems to be at the brink of collapse, but there is no time for despair. The artist asks us to acknowledge our own role in the game of power and realize that the machine is not the other, it is us.</p>
